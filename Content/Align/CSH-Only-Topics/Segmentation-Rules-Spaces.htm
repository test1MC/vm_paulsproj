                    <p>Let’s say you have the date Feb. 21 (with a space between) and want to make sure it appears in the same segment. Without a segmentation rule, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will break the segment after Feb. because it thinks it is the end of a sentence. </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The segments are aligned, but they are not segmented the way you want. You can create a rule by entering Feb. in the After cell and 21 in the Before cell. However, when you enter 21 in the Before cell, make sure you also add a space before it. Otherwise, the segment will break only if it comes across Feb.21 (with no space) but not if it comes across Feb. 21 (with a space).</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>After reimporting the project, the segment looks like this. Segmentation rules created in Align are applied to both the source and target segments, if applicable.</p>
