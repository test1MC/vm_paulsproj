        <p>If you are a member of the Administrators or Employees group, there are two user interfaces for moderating the activity in your Pulse system. You can use the Flare output or the Pulse dashboard to moderate activity in a variety of ways.</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly">
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Approve (Moderate) Posts </span>You can specify that all posts must first be approved by a moderator before they are displayed publicly. If you are subscribed to the topic, you will receive an email notification when there is a new pending post. You can then click the link to that topic and accept or reject the post. See <MadCap:xref href="Moderating-Posts.htm">Moderating Posts</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Contact Registered Users </span>You can use the chat feature or send messages to registered users. See <MadCap:xref href="Contacting-Registered-Users.htm">Contacting Registered Users</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Customize and Use the Your Apps Menu </span>The Your Apps menu gives you access to a variety of Pulse tools. See <MadCap:xref href="../Your-Apps/Customizing-Your-Apps.htm">Customizing the Your Apps Menu</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Follow Community Activities </span>You can stay connected with the users in your community by following a variety of activities. See <MadCap:xref href="Following-Community-Activities.htm">Following Community Activities</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Invite&#160;People </span>You can invite members of the Administrators and Employees group to join groups, follow tags, or follow users. See <MadCap:xref href="Inviting-People.htm">Inviting People</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Manage Tasks </span>Members of the Customers group can assign tasks to any registered user. In addition, members of the Administrators and Employees group can assign tasks to each other. Administrators and Employees can respond to tasks posted by others and manage their own tasks. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PulseGuides.PulseUserGuide">See <MadCap:xref href="../Your-Apps/Tasks.htm">Managing&#160;Tasks</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.PulseOnlineOnly">See <MadCap:xref href="../Posting-Content/Assigning-Tasks.htm">Assigning Tasks</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="Responding-Tasks.htm">Responding to Tasks</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../Your-Apps/Tasks.htm">Tasks</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Read it Later </span>You can add posts to a personalized list of items to read later. This is a useful feature when users have questions that you can't answer immediately. See <MadCap:xref href="Reading-Later.htm">Bookmarking a Post to Read it Later</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../Your-Apps/Read-Later.htm">Read it Later</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Respond to Posts </span>Perhaps one of the most important tasks is to develop social relationships with your end users. One of the best ways to accomplish this is by responding to user posts in a timely manner. See <MadCap:xref href="Responding-Status-Updates.htm">Responding to Status Updates</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="Responding-Questions.htm">Responding to Questions</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="Responding-Articles.htm">Responding to Articles</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="Responding-Tasks.htm">Responding to Tasks</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Share Posts </span>You can share Pulse posts on your own feed, on someone else's feed, and in a group. See <MadCap:xref href="Sharing-Posts.htm">Sharing Posts</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Subscribe to Feeds </span>You can subscribe to feeds that you are responsible for moderating. While this feature is available to all registered users, it is a particularly important task for Administrators or Employees who want to be notified when end users post status updates, questions, articles, and tasks. See <MadCap:xref href="Subscribing-Topics.htm">Subscribing to Feeds</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Tag Content </span>The Pulse dashboard provides members of the Administrators and Employees group with access to a Tags menu where they can perform more advanced tagging activities (see <MadCap:xref href="../Dashboard/Tags/Using-Tags-Menu.htm">Using the Tags Menu</MadCap:xref>). All registered users can create and apply tags to posts (see <MadCap:xref href="../Responding-Posts/Tagging-Posts.htm">Tagging Posts</MadCap:xref>). </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Work With Favorites </span>You can create lists of favorites and give your lists any name you want to help you monitor activity and information in Pulse. See <MadCap:xref href="Working-Favorites.htm">Working with Favorites</MadCap:xref>.</li>
