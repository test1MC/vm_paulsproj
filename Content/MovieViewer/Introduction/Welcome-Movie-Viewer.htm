        <p>Welcome to the MadCap Movie Viewer. This viewer is used to display movies and movie collections that you have created using MadCap Mimic. An integrated TOC in the Movie Viewer lets users navigate from one movie to another (if there is more than one movie).</p>
        <p>Mimic is <MadCap:variable name="Other.CompanyName" />'s movie-making software. Because Mimic uses advanced compression techniques, your movies will be much smaller than they normally would be if you were to use other movie-making software. This results in smaller overall output and faster loading for end users. All video tutorials and movies in the online Help for MadCap Flare and Mimic were created with Mimic.</p>
