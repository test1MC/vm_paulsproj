            <MadCap:keyword term="Images:inserting" />Insert Image Dialog</h1>
        <p>This dialog opens when you attempt to insert an image in an element such as a page layout or a stylesheet property, or a background element (e.g., in a paragraph). By using the buttons in the local toolbar, you can view all image files in a list, view files in their folder structure, and use other options. If you want to add one of your 20 most recently used images to the project, you can select an image from the Recently Used Images group. If you want to add one of your pinned—or favorite—images to the project, you can select a snippet from the Pinned Images group. You also can click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/browse_ellipses.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" MadCap:conditions="FlareGuides.FlareNotPrintedManual" /> to find and select an image file outside of the project.</p>
