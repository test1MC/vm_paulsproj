If a user is re-invited to the license, he or she would have to be re-added to any teams, tasks, or projects that they previously belonged to.</p>
            <p>If a user belongs to other Central licenses, his or her profile and avatar are maintained and the user will still have access to those licenses. If the user does not belong to any other licenses, his or her profile and avatar are deleted.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to recover a user's profile and avatar once he or she has been deleted. Instead, you would need to re-invite that person to Central and create the profile again.</p>
