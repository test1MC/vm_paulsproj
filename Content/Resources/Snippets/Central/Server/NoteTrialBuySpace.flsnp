When you purchase the license, the amount of space selected in the Purchase dialog must be at least as much as the amount you’re already using in trial mode. If you do not want to purchase that much space, you must first clean up your existing space (e.g., delete builds, projects, or other data taking up unnecessary space) before continuing with the purchase.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Deleting-Builds.htm">Deleting Builds</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Deleting-Projects.htm">Deleting Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
