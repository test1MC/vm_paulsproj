You continue to author your project content locally in Flare. If you are working in a single-bound model, you then commit your files and synchronize (pull, push) your changes with the cloned project on Central. If you are working in a dual-bound model, you use your normal (third-party) source control tool to synchronize your files and then use Flare to push those changes to Central. Whichever method you use, this ensures that your files are up-to-date in Central before you build output. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Committing-Synchronizing-Single-Bound.htm">Committing and Synchronizing (Pull, Push) in a Single-bound Model</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Pushing-Dual-Bound-Model.htm">Pushing in a Dual-bound Model</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
