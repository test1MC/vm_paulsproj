        <p>You can click <span class="Emphasis">Build Management</span> on the right side of the interface to work with the targets in the project. The Build Management view lets you generate, open, and manage output from a target. This includes the ability to set certain builds as “Live,” meaning they can be viewed by the public. You can also mark other builds to “Keep,” in case you need to roll back to them for some reason.</p>
