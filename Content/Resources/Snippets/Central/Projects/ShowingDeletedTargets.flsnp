    <body>If you have multiple targets in your project, over time you may need to remove some of those targets from your Flare project. However, your builds will remain in Central. You can view these deleted targets in Central, so you know which targets in Central have been “orphaned” and no longer have an associated target in the local Flare project. </body>
