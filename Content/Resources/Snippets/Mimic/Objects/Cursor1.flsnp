        <p>If you automatically add cursors to your recorded movies<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Mimic/Objects/Cursors/Automatically-Adding-Cursors-to-Recorded-Movies.htm">Automatically Adding Cursors to Recorded Movies</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>, you may want to edit their paths, or trajectories, before you publish your finished movie. You might want to do this to simplify the cursor motion or to add a motion that you did not capture in the original recording. Likewise, if you did not automatically add cursors to your recording, you can add a cursor to your movie and create a new trajectory from scratch.</p>
