        <p> Using Google Search involves a combination of steps on your Google Internet account, in addition to a few steps in Flare. Not all of the steps in your Google account are required for integrating search with Flare, but they are recommended. Also, the exact steps that you follow may be somewhat different if you are using a free Google account as opposed to a paid account.</p>
