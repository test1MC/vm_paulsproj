If you do not have a public and private SSH key, your can generate these keys using your Git source control provider (e.g., Gitlab). Follow the directions provided by your source control provider to add these keys to your Git account. Once you generate these keys, they are typically found in the <span class="Emphasis">C:\Users\[username]\.ssh</span> folder on your computer.</p>
            <p>Public keys typically have a .pub extension. Private keys use the same file name as the public key, but without the file extension.</p>
