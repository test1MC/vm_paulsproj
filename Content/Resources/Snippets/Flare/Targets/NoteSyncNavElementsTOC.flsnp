You can create a snippet that holds all of the content for the topic. Then create multiple topics (as many topics as you need links to it in the TOC), and insert that snippet into each one. Rather than linking to one topic in multiple places in the TOC, you can link to a different topic in each place. By doing that, your navigation elements will point to the appropriate locations. However, you probably also want to disable searching in all but one of those topics; otherwise, they will all show up in the search results<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Topics/Including-Excluding-Topics-in-Search.htm">Including or Excluding Topics in Search</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
