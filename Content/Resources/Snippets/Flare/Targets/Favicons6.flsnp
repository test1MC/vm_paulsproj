        <p>Many writers may only need one Favicons skin component for an entire project. This is true even if you have multiple targets. That’s because you can use a variable in the Web URL field (in the Windows section of the Favicons Skin Editor, under Options) in order to account for different publishing locations. However, if you find that you need to create multiple Favicons skin components for various targets, you can associate each skin component with the appropriate target on the Skin tab of the Target Editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Skins/Associating-Skin-Components-with-Targets.htm">Associating Skin Components with Targets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
