        <p class="Subheading">Flare running too slowly</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
        <p>This might occur for any number of reasons, some having to do with <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> and some not.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
        <p>Try any of the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Analyzer Scanning (Disable) </span>One possibility has to do with Analyzer and the scanning that takes place for projects. Try disabling the certain types of information from being included in these scans. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Analyzer/Enabling-Analyzer-Scans.htm">Enabling Analyzer Scans</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Conditional Indicators (Disable) </span>Try disabling conditional indicators in window panes, such as the Content Explorer. Conditional indicators require large amounts of memory to run. To disable conditional indicators in a window pane, click the <img src="../../../Images/Shared/hide_show_conditional_indicators_btn.png" alt="" title="" /> button so that the condition tag indicators are hidden.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Spell Check While Typing (Disable) </span>Try disabling the option to spell check while typing. This can be found in the Tools ribbon. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Spell-Check/Spell-Checking-While-Typing.htm">Spell Checking While Typing</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Window Panes (Close) </span>Try closing some window panes, especially those that have a lot of data, such as the File List window pane and Index window pane. Leaving many window panes open can be a drain on memory resources. </li>
        </ul>
