        <p>For online outputs, creating an index is typically done via a skin. By default, the MadCap style that controls index proxies is set to support only print-based outputs. However, you can change this. To do so, open your stylesheet, select the <span class="Emphasis">MadCap|indexProxy</span> style, and set the <span class="Emphasis">mc-output-support</span> property to <span class="Emphasis">all</span> (all-print is the default setting). By doing this, you can use the index proxy method to generate an index in some online outputs as well.</p>
