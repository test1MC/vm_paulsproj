        <p>As you click on each factory template, a preview to the right describes how each one is configured. If you click on one of your previously created row styles, you will see some default text. This text was added as a comment for that new style. You can open your stylesheet and replace this text with whatever you want to describe your layout. This can be especially useful if you work with a team of authors who will be creating responsive layouts.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Styles/More/Adding-Comments-to-Styles.htm">Adding Comments to Styles</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly"> For more information on adding comments to styles, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
