Therefore, you can quickly send the file to a reviewer and that person will initially only see content with conditions that you have included. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Reviews/Sending-Files-for-Review.htm">Sending Files for Review</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
