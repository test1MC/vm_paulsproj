        <p>Please note that this is not the same as <span class="EmphasisItalic">applying conditions</span> to actual content<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Applying-Condition-Tags-to-Content.htm">Applying Condition Tags to Content</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Nor does this feature affect the output, as do the settings in the Target Editor<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineOnly"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Associating-Condition-Tags-with-Targets.htm">Associating Condition Tags with Targets</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Rather, this functions more like a preview feature. It simply lets you temporarily remove from view content that is associated with certain condition tags so that you can see how the file looks without that content.</p>
        <p>Usually when editing, you want to see the file as it is intended for a particular target. Therefore, although you can manually select conditions to include or exclude from view, the best approach is usually to click the <span class="Emphasis">Target Expressions</span> drop-down and choose a target. The condition settings from that target are then replicated in this dialog, thus saving you time and effort.</p>
