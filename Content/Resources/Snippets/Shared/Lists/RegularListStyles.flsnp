        <p>You can modify the look of lists by making adjustments to the standard CSS list styles and/or creating style classes. By using these list styles, you can affect things such as the alignment, background, bullet images, and indentation of lists. There are a handful of list styles, but the ones you are most likely to use to control lists are the ol and ul styles (for ordered and unordered lists, respectively).</p>
