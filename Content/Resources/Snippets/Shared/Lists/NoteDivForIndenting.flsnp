        <p>A &lt;div&gt; tag is a good way to indent lots of content. For example, you might have a section of content containing four paragraphs, a numbered list, and an image. Rather than creating special style classes for all of those different elements with an indentation setting (e.g., margin-left or padding-left) on each, you can place your indentation setting on the div style. That way, any content contained within that &lt;div&gt; tag will be indented accordingly.</p>
