        <p>An advanced (or "complex") selector lets you format content based on very specific criteria. You can use advanced selectors when creating lists to automatically use different styles for each level in a multi-level list. For example, you could create a multi-level list that uses one style for the first li, a different style for the second li, and a completely different style for the third li.</p>
