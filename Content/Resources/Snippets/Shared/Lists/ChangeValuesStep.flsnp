        <p>If you are using the group view, expand the property groups as necessary and change the values. <MadCap:snippetText src="../Styles/PropertyNameLeftValueRight.flsnp" /> The way you change the values depends on the kind of property. For some properties, you simply click and type text in the field. For others, you click and select an option from the drop-down. And for others you might need to adjust settings in a small popup.</p>
