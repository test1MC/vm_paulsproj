        <p>Opens the File List window pane, which lets you view all of the content files in your project in alphabetical order. You can limit the files that are displayed by using the file type filter. For example, if you want to see only your image files, you could select the "Image/Media Files" option from the Filter drop-down list. You can also perform certain tasks from this window pane, such as opening files, applying condition tags, and applying stylesheets. And because you can select multiple files from the list, you can perform these tasks for all of the selected files at the same time. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Interface/UI-Elements/File-List-Window.htm">File List Window Pane</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Lingo">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Lingo/Interface/UI-Elements/File-List-Window.htm">File List Window Pane</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
