        <p>Much of the work in MadCap Central (e.g., management of users, teams, tasks, projects, and builds) requires user interactions to be performed through a browser. In addition to Flare requiring end-to-end encryption, all traffic from your web browser to the MadCap Central portal is also secured using industry standard security practices such as SSL.</p>
