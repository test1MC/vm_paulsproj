For details, see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/global-datacenters" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/global-datacenters</a>.</p>
        <p>The primary data center is located in Sacramento, California. A secondary read-only data center is located in Chicago, Illinois.

        <p> In addition to data stored in the database, the source control provider (Git) has the ability to failover in case of an outage. This is essential in handling mission critical data in the event of a catastrophe.</p>
