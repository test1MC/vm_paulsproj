        <p>You can turn off the condition toggle button mentioned above. Then make sure this button (located at the bottom of the XML Editor) is enabled to show or hide the tag block bar to the left of the topic. The tag bar is shaded with a lighter version of the tag color. This is a good feature to use if you find the shading of the actual content distracting.</p>
