        <p>If you insert cross-references into topics and then later edit the formats for those cross-references<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> (or make other changes in the project that might affect them)</MadCap:conditionalText>, you can update the cross-references in a topic. By updating cross-references, you are essentially refreshing them so that they reflect any pertinent changes<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> in the project</MadCap:conditionalText> since you inserted them.</p>
