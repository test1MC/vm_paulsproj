        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> there are many ways that you can link one file with another, thus creating a dependency. Link dependencies are created when you perform tasks such as: inserting a text hyperlink, inserting an image, applying a stylesheet to a topic, and more. The Link Viewer window pane lets you see what other files a particular file is linked to and from.</p>
