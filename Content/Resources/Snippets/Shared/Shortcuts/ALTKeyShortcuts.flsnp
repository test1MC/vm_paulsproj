        <p>As an alternative to using the standard shortcut key combinations for different features in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can use ALT key shortcuts. These are shortcuts that become visible as popups over specific areas of the interface (in ribbon mode) or underlined text (in tool strip mode)&#160;when you press the ALT key. You can then select the key shown to access the relevant feature.</p>
