        <p>In addition to all of the built-in dictionaries that are installed on your computer, you can develop custom dictionaries. You can think of these as supplements to the built-in dictionaries. A custom dictionary is created and modified automatically whenever you perform a spell check and tell <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that a questionable word is okay and should be added to a dictionary.</p>
