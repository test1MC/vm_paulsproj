        <p>If you want to have different rules for your topics, you can open add new style classes for each different horizontal line. For example, if you want a short rule, you can create a new style class based on the hr style and name it "short." The full name for you new style would be hr.short. You can then adjust the style property settings for hr.short to meet your needs.</p>
