        <p>When you are finished editing files, you can commit them to source control. If you are working with Git, committing a file adds your changes to the local database.  When you are ready to add your local commits to the remote repository, you can push these files to the remote. If you are working with Subversion, committing a file overwrites the old copy of the file in the source control database with the new one from your local machine. You will see this option if your project is bound to Git or Subversion.</p>
