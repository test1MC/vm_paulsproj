        <p>One of the benefits of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s integrated source control is that you can view the history for a particular file, including who checked in the file and when it was checked in. You can also view differences between different versions of the file and roll back to an older version if necessary. You will see this option for all source control providers.</p>
