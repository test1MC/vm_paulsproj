Each of the source control providers built-in to <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> uses different terms. As such, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s source control interface is different depending on which source control provider you use. Please refer to the sections for each source control provider if you need to see information about the terms used by other built-in systems.</p>
