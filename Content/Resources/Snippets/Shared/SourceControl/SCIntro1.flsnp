        <p>Source control is a process where you store a copy of your project on a server, allowing you to “check in” and “check out” files and keep your changes in sync with other writers. Source control is even useful for single authors because it provides a means for maintaining a constant backup of all project files. <![CDATA[                    ]]></p>
