However, if you are using a source-control provider other than Git, the most recently pushed files are the ones that are used in Central. In other words, the last person to push "wins." To avoid issues, be sure that everyone working on your project has the most recent version of the files before you push. You may even want to limit users' permissions<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> (see the Central online Help)</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.CentralOnlineOnly"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Users/Setting-Permissions.htm">Setting User Permissions</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>&#160;so only one or two people are allowed to push files.</p>
