        <p>Variables are brief, non-formatted pieces of content (such as the name of your company’s product or phone number) that can be edited in one place but used in many places. A variable has two main components—the variable <span class="EmphasisItalic">name</span> and the variable <span class="EmphasisItalic">definition</span>. When you insert a variable, the user sees the variable definition in the output. If you later need to modify the definition of a variable, you only need to change it in one place and the change is made automatically everywhere that the variable is inserted.</p>
