        <p>A snippet is an important file used for single-sourcing that acts sort of like a miniature topic. In a snippet, you can insert and format text, tables, pictures, and whatever else can be included in a normal topic. We’re not usually talking about single words or phrases; that’s what variables are for. A snippet can be inserted into one or more topics throughout your project.  You can even insert them into other snippets, creating nested snippets.</p>
