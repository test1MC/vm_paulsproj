            <p>Let's say that you have created in your stylesheet a class of the img style called "button" (i.e., img.button) and you have set a maximum size on that style class. The idea is that you want to use that style class whenever you insert an image of a button, ensuring that the image always displays in a very small size. Rather than using the default parent img style when you insert the image, you select img.button from the Style Class drop-down.</p>
