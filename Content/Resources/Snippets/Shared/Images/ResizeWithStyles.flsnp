        <p>You can resize many images at once by using the img style in the Stylesheet Editor. Not only can you select a specific image size, but you can also set a maximum or minimum height or width. You can set either the width or height on the image tag and let <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> set the other property automatically, maintaining the aspect ratio (i.e., size proportion of the image).</p>
