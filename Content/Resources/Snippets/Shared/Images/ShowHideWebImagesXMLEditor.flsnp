        <p>You might have many image tags that link to websites, rather than linking to images in the project.</p>
        <p>For example: &lt;img src="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/images/home/company.png" /&gt;</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that slow website response times may slow down your work. Therefore, you might want to disable the rendering of such images in the XML Editor.</p>
