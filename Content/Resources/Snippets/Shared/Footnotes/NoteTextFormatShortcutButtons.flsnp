        <p>As an alternative to using the Footnote Properties dialog, for some changes (e.g., bold, italic, font color) you can use the shortcut buttons in the Text Format toolbar. If you want to make changes to the comment text only (as opposed to both the comment text and the numbers), this is the method to use.</p>
