            <li>Place your cursor inside the table where you want to insert the row. Doing this will insert only one row when you are finished.</li>
            <li>In a table, click and drag to select the number of rows you want to add (e.g., if you want to insert three rows, select three in the table). You do not need to select entire rows, just portions of them.</li>
