In this situation, you will still use the MadCap Central window pane and Source Control ribbon in Flare to manage your changes. However, you are able to push and pull files from <span class="EmphasisItalic">either</span> Central or your Git repository. As a result, your Git repository and your Central repository might be completely different, and you may encounter conflicts. In this situation, Flare's Conflict Resolution dialog will open and you can accept or reject the changes. It is recommended that you establish an internal workflow to dictate the order in which you push and pull from each repository to prevent conflicts and ensure that your files in Central stay up-to-date.</p>
