        <p>With the dual-bound model, you do not use the Source Control ribbon in Flare to perform tasks related to Central's internal source control connection with the files; instead, use the MadCap Central window pane in Flare. The Source Control ribbon would be used only for your other binding with a third-party version control tool.</p>
