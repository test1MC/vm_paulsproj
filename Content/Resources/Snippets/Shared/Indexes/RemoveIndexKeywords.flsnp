        <p>You can use either the top or bottom area of the window pane to remove index keywords and subkeywords. The difference is that deleting a keyword from the top section removes that keyword from the active topic or snippet only. On the other hand, deleting a keyword from the bottom section removes that keyword from all topics or snippets where it is inserted.</p>
