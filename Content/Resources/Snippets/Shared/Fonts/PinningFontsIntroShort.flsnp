        <p>You can pin your favorite fonts <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">and font sets </MadCap:conditionalText>so they will appear at the top of the list. This makes them easier to find later. Pinned fonts<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> and font sets</MadCap:conditionalText> appear in a group that you can expand or collapse. This is a way to limit the list of fonts to those that you use the most and hide from view those that you do not use.</p>
