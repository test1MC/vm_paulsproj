        <p>Indenting in this way will apply local formatting to your tag. It is recommended that you instead modify the style for this content, setting the first line indent (i.e., text-indent) property in the Stylesheet Editor. Using a style means the setting will automatically be applied to any content using that style throughout the project, whereas local formatting affects only the particular content that you are working on.</p>
