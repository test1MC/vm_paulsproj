        <p>After you insert a QR code into a <MadCap:snippetText src="../Topics/ContentFileDocument.flsnp" />, you can easily move that QR code around. To do this, simply click on the QR code and drag it to the new location. A vertical red bar serves as a guide as you move the mouse. When you release the mouse button, the QR code will be moved to the location identified by the vertical red bar.</p>
