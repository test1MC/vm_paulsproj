        <p>After you align segments, you should upload them to your translation memory database. If you select specific segments and click <img src="../../../Images/Shared/upload_file_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar, only those translations will be uploaded. If you click <img src="../../../Images/Shared/upload_selected_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar, all translations in the file will be uploaded.</p>
