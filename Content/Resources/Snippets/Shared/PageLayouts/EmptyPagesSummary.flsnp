        <p>When creating print-based output, there may be times when you want a page in the document to purposely be left blank (or mostly blank). Flare lets you use three kinds of empty page types in a page layout. If you add one of these empty page types in a page layout, empty pages can automatically be injected into the output when necessary, based on the page types in your layout.</p>
