        <p>When you insert a text box, you can make selections to affect the look of the box (e.g., border background, size). In addition, text boxes are based on <MadCap:keyword term="DIV tag" />div styles that you can select when inserting them. Therefore, you can always change the settings on a div style to automatically modify the look of all text boxes using that same div style.</p>
