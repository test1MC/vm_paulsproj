        <p>Wrap behavior on line breaks determines how and when the line ends  and begins (or "wraps") on &lt;br/&gt; tags from one line to the next. It also determines how white space is treated when the line wraps. Wrap behavior is controlled by the <span class="Emphasis">white-space</span> property.</p>
