            <p>Let's say that you have created in your stylesheet a class of the object style called "BigMargin" (i.e., object.BigMargin) and you have set the margin for all sides of that class to 1 inch. Rather than using the default parent object style when you insert the audio, you select object.BigMargin from the Style Class drop-down. As a result, 1 inch of space is added around the audio interface in the output.</p>
