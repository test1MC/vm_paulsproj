            <p>Let's say that you have created in your stylesheet a class of the MadCap|model3D style called "border" (i.e., MadCap|model3D.border) and you have set the border for all sides of that class to 10 pixels. Rather than using the default parent MadCap|model3D style when you insert the 3D model, you select MadCap|model3D.border from the Style Class drop-down. As a result, 10 pixels are added around the 3D model in the output.</p>
